# techdegree-project-5
This is the fifth project in the Treehouse FSJS techdegree curriculum.
This project its purpose is to call the RandomUser API and use the retrieved data to build a Random Employee directory.
For every user retrieved there will be a card and modal generated.

To start using this project, clone the repo and run the index.html file in your browser. 

I've written this project in vanilla JS and decided to stick with the Fetch API to learn more about promises.
